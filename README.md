# Posture Corrector Device


## Overview
This posture corrector is designed to help users maintain a healthy posture by utilizing technology and immediate feedback. Built with an STM32 microcontroller and three MPU6050 gyroscopes, this device actively monitors the inclination of the neck, upper back, and lower back. When poor posture is detected, a mini vibration motor alerts the user to adjust their posture to a healthier alignment.

## Features
